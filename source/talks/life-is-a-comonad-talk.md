## Overview

I have recently been grappling with the concept of a Comonad, and found that there are quite a few articles that explain their theoretical footing, but not many that convey an intuitive understanding of Comonads using practical examples.

In this talk I will introduce comonads using the Zipper data structure as an analogy, then show how this data structure, along with its comonad instance can be used to implement Conway's Game Of Life.
