I am currently a Senior Software Engineer at [Tapad](https://www.tapad.com/), where I lead a team working on infrastructure and deployment automation. 

My first programming language was Haskell, but I was diverted into enterprise java for quite some time. I have always maintained my passion for functional programming and in the last few years have convinced my workplace to embrace scala and functional programming techniques. I believe strong static typing, and purity are the only way to maintain your sanity while implementing complex distributed systems.
